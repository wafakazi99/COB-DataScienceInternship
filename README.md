**CodesOnBytes Data Science Internship**


**Overview**


Welcome to the CodesOnBytes Data Science Internship! This internship is designed to provide hands-on experience in various aspects of data science. In Phase 1, you will work on creating a CSV dataset using Python, Pandas, and any public API. Subsequently, you'll dive into cleaning the dataset, analyzing it, and creating visualizations. In Phase 2, you'll explore further analysis and delve into training a simple linear regression model.


**Phase 1: Dataset Creation and Cleaning**


Task 1: Create a CSV dataset using Python, Pandas, and any public API
To get started, you will use Python and the Pandas library to create a dataset from a public API. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with the appropriate API key and customize the script as needed. This dataset will be the foundation for your subsequent tasks.

Task 2: Clean the dataset
In this task, focus on data cleaning processes such as replacing missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.


**Phase 2: Dataset Analysis and Regression**


Task 1: Analyze the dataset and create graphs using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Utilize the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to perform exploratory data analysis. Generate insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset.

Task 2: Train a simple linear regression model on the dataset and predict the output
Take a step into machine learning by training a simple linear regression model. Use Python libraries like Scikit-Learn to build and train the model on your dataset. Predict the output and evaluate the model's performance.
